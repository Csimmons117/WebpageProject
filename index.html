                        Hi, I'm Cameron Simmons. I created this website to learn more about web development. 
                        Through this project, I've been exploring HTML, CSS, domain management, DNS, SSL/TLS security, and using a Linux server to host everything. 
                        This site is a way for me to put these skills into practice and continue learning.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In addition to showcasing my work, this site also highlights my professional background in computer information technology. You can find my 
                        resume <a class="resume" href="./files/ResumeWebsite.pdf">here</a>, which includes details about my qualifications, past projects, and relevant experience. I'm always open to connecting with potential
                        collaborators and employers, and I'm excited to explore new opportunities in the field of IT.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                        I have hands-on experience with IT tools like Linux networking, AWS, 
                        Git, and ESXi, which help manage computer systems, networks, and 
                        virtual environments. I’m comfortable setting up and troubleshooting 
                        networks, using cloud services like AWS, and managing code with Git. 
                        In addition to technical skills, I’m experienced in writing detailed 
                        documents on topics like digital forensics and incident response, and 
                        I use Microsoft Office to create clear reports, presentations, and 
                        other documentation. I also have strong interpersonal skills, including 
                        teaching, leading teams, solving problems creatively, and providing excellent
                         customer service to ensure everything runs smoothly and clients are satisfied.
